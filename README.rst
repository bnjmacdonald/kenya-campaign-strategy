Goal
====

Get data on campaign activity for NASA and Jubilee. This includes transcripts of what is said, as well as where they go and what they do in these locations. This will involve: (a) collecting as much online material as possible that says something about a campaign event; (b) divide the data between quotes/transcripts and contextual information; (c) figure out how we want to parse each.
